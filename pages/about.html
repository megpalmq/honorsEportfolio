    <h2>Hi, i'm Megan</h2>
    <p>
      I'm Megan, a Media Arts and Science student at Indiana University
      Indianapolis with a focus on web design, development, and digital
      storytelling. I enjoy creating digital experiences that feel thoughtful,
      intentional, and easy to connect with. Design has become a space for me to
      combine creativity with problem solving, and I am especially interested in
      how visual storytelling can shape meaningful user experiences. <br />
      <br />Throughout my time in the Honors Program, I have focused on growing
      both professionally and personally. I have taken on leadership roles,
      collaborated on creative projects, and stayed involved in campus
      organizations that have pushed me to step outside my comfort zone. These
      experiences have helped me better understand who I am, how I work with
      others, and what I value moving forward. <br /><br />This portfolio
      represents the work and growth that have shaped my college experience so
      far. It reflects my curiosity, dedication, and desire to keep learning. As
      I move into the next stage of my education and career, I hope to continue
      creating work that feels purposeful and reflective of the person I am
      becoming.
