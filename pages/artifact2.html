    <h2>Potential Options for best artifact</h2>
    <p>
      For Showcase 2, I will feature my involvement in the Design for Dignity
      project, which began as a class project focused on improving health and
      wellness resources for elderly individuals in collaboration with the Boner
      Community Center. What started as an academic assignment evolved into a
      larger, community-centered initiative. Through this experience, our work
      moved beyond the classroom and became part of a broader effort to support
      elderly populations through thoughtful, research-driven design. I later
      contributed to developing the Design for Dignity website, helping
      transform the project into a more permanent and professional digital
      platform. This experience stands out to me because it demonstrates how I
      can take a class-based concept and expand it into something with
      real-world impact.
      <br /><br />
      Artifact(s) I Plan to Include To document and illustrate my learning, I
      plan to include:
      <li>
        Visuals from the original class project (brochures, posters, or research
        materials related to elderly health)
      </li>
      <li>Screenshots of the Design for Dignity website</li>
      <li>
        Development process work (wireframes, design mockups, or code
        screenshots)
      </li>
      <li>
        Any documentation showing the evolution from classroom project to
        community-focused initiative.
      </li>
      <br>
      <p> These artifacts will demonstrate both the original research and design
      work as well as the technical development that helped bring the project to
      a broader audience.</p>
