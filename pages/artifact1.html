    <h2>INTRO</h2>
    <p>My name is Megan Palmquist, and I am a web and graphic designer at Indiana University Indianapolis, studying Media Arts and Science with a focus on web design, development, and digital storytelling, along with a minor in graphic design. Throughout my time in the Honors College, I have intentionally sought out opportunities that allow me to grow both creatively and personally while contributing meaningfully to the communities I am part of. My experiences in coursework, leadership roles, internships, and collaborative projects have shaped not only my technical skill set, but also my understanding of the responsibility designers have when creating for others.</p>

    <h2>Original H200 Statement</h2>
    <p>In my time at IUPUI and as an honors student, I want to continue to devote my time to my career education and my personal interests. I will contribute the time to keep discovering what type of person I want to become. I want to continue giving back to the community as a requirement and as part of a higher quality of life. It fills me with great joy that I can participate in many clubs like SAPB, and Girl Gains to set me up for different life experiences in my future. These groups get me more involved in different aspects of college life that will also most likely show up again in the future. In other aspects, I want to participate in more internships to fully grasp the skills to be a better people person and accommodate and assist any type of person no matter who they might be. I want to become someone people can say is a good human. I want to continue the organized lifestyle that will inspire others around me to also become the best versions of themselves. If I can inspire others and teach them something new or maybe how to look at life from a different perspective, I will be content. I want to bring forth to the world a part of myself that deems to be helpful to society. Overall, I want to grow as a person, if I end college being the same person I was when I entered college, what was it all for?</p>

    <h2>My New Statement</h2>
    <p>My name is Megan Palmquist, and I am a web and graphic designer at Indiana University Indianapolis, studying Media Arts and Science with a focus on web design, development, and digital storytelling, along with a minor in graphic design. Throughout my time in the Honors College, I have intentionally sought out opportunities that allow me to grow both creatively and personally while contributing meaningfully to the communities I am part of. My experiences in coursework, leadership roles, internships, and collaborative projects have shaped not only my technical skill set, but also my understanding of the responsibility designers have when creating for others.
      <br>
      <br>
      I have participated in a wide range of experiences that have influenced who I am today and who I am becoming as a creative professional. Through internships and client-based projects, I have strengthened my skills in web development, branding, and user-centered design while learning how to collaborate with teams and adapt to real-world constraints. Serving as a Teaching Assistant for an Introduction to Web Design course and as a co-leader for OTEAM allowed me to mentor others, communicate complex ideas clearly, and support students as they navigated new learning environments. Additionally, my involvement in organizations such as SAPB and my work in content strategy further reinforced my interest in creating engaging, accessible experiences that bring people together.
      <br>
      <br>
      Looking ahead, I am committed to building a career in which creativity, empathy, and purpose intersect. I aim to continue designing digital experiences that are not only visually compelling, but also thoughtful, inclusive, and impactful. As I transition from student to professional, I carry forward the same values that guided my early college intentions — growth, community, and being a good human — now supported by experience, confidence, and a clear professional direction.</p>
