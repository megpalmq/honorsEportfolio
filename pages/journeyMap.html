    <h1>Reflecting on Introduction to Honors 200 Journey Map</h1>
    <p>
      Over the past four years, my college journey has transformed the person I
      thought I was into the person I am today. I’ve experienced opportunities I
      never imagined possible and accomplished many of the goals I set for
      myself as a freshman. While my career plans have evolved along the way, I
      have remained committed to completing my journey and making the most of
      every opportunity. In Honors 200, I created a Journey Map to visualize
      where I wanted my college experience to lead me, using it as a guide to
      identify the steps needed to reach my goals. Looking back at that map now,
      I can clearly see how many of those goals I’ve achieved. Together, my
      Honors 200 Journey Map and my actual college experience highlight the
      milestones I set out to reach and the progress I've made along the way.
      <br /><br />
      Take a moment to explore how I reached these milestones, pushed myself to
      get involved, and worked to create a lasting impact.

    <h1>Reflecting Freshman to Senior Year</h1>
    <p>
      When I first started college as a freshman, I was excited but also unsure
      of what direction my journey would take. I knew I was interested in design
      and technology, but I wasn't fully confident in my skills yet or how I
      would fit into the professional world. One of my biggest goals early on
      was to push myself outside my comfort zone, get involved on campus, and
      gain hands-on experience that would help me grow both creatively and
      professionally. I quickly learned that college would be less about having
      everything figured out and more about being open to learning and trying
      new things.
      <br /><br />
      Looking back now, I'm proud of how much I've grown since those early
      semesters. Throughout my time at IU Indianapolis, I've taken on a variety
      of roles that shaped my college experience. I became involved in
      leadership and mentorship positions, including serving as a co-leader for
      OTEAM and as a Teaching Assistant for an Introduction to Web Design
      course. I also balanced creative and professional roles outside the
      classroom, working as a brand and web designer, content strategist, and
      bobarista, all while continuing to build my portfolio and refine my skills
      in web design, development, and graphic design. <br /><br />
      These experiences allowed me to build strong connections with classmates,
      faculty, and professionals while developing skills such as communication,
      leadership, time management, and problem-solving. Some of the most
      meaningful moments came from collaborating on real-world projects,
      mentoring younger students, and working on design work that addressed
      social issues and community impact. Through internships and hands-on
      projects, I gained valuable industry experience that helped bridge the gap
      between academic learning and professional practice. <br /><br />
      As I look ahead, I feel confident and prepared for the next chapter of my
      journey. Everything I've been involved in—from coursework to leadership
      roles to internships—has helped shape who I am as a designer and
      professional. While my goals continue to evolve, I'm excited to carry the
      lessons, skills, and connections I've gained into my future career,
      knowing that my college experience has laid a strong foundation for what's
      next.
